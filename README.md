# About Jammming

Jammming is a (completely useless ;) responsive react web app that uses the Spotify API to:

    display the user's Spotify playlists
    search for music tracks
    create a playlist
    save the playlist to the user's Spotify account.

This project was built for the Codecademy Pro 'Front-End-Engineer' career path, and Codecademy retains copyright of the web design and assets.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
